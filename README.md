## What the Code Does
- Uploads the dataset 
- Performs data cleaning (drops exluded data, imputes missing data, recodes variables as appropriate)
- Creates desciptives tables and figures
- Runs regression to determine association of interest

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository to your computer
2. Visit the link above and download the 2024 BRFSS "Data (SAS Transport Format)" data
3. Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where the files are
